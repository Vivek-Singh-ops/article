    <h2>Article 1: The Rise of AI</h2>
    <div class="content">
      Artificial Intelligence is transforming industries across the globe. From healthcare to finance, eural
       circuits—the networks of interconnected neurons that underlie our every action—are controlled by roughly 
       100 known neurochemicals in the brain. To date, neuroscientists have employed sensors that rely on a limited
        number of fluorescent proteins, such as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) found in jellyfish, to track an
         individual neurochemical in living animal models. But how might they track more neurochemicals 
         simultaneously to get a better handle on the brain’s daunting complexity?

Now, an international team has developed a new sensor that expands the color palette to include chemical dyes in the far-red wavelength. The work, recently reported in Science, could help reveal how various neurochemicals interact together in healthy brains—and how they fall out of sync in the case of disease.AI is enabling smarter decisions and automation...

The team designed their new sensor to track dopamine, a neurochemical known to play key roles in movement, motivation, and other
 behaviors. But this same tool could be adapted to follow other individual neurochemicals, says lead author and neuroscientist Yulong 
 Li of Peking University in Beijing, China.

The researchers began with a stretch of DNA, in vitro, that encodes a human dopamine receptor. They then inserted a gene that expresses
 a specialized protein that can capture chemical dyes not unlike those developed by the textile industry over the past hundred years, e
 xplains Li. Li and his team next inserted this DNA into cultured neurons so the cells would produce this altered dopamine receptor. Wh
 en they added dye in the far-red color range, the dye-capture proteins bound to it. But importantly, the dye wasn’t yet visible.
